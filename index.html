         HTML5 feature detection and Polyfills.
         XHTML5 is HTML that is compatible with XML. Feels more like a programing language.
         Only way to prove that webpage is valid. Web pages are then machine readable.
         It's more verbose.
      </p>

      <p>
         <h3>XML - Extensible Markup Language.</h3>
         Choose tags, surround stuff with tags. Use a tree to parse (think like a file navigation tree).
      </p>
         <ul>
            <li>In HTML4 ul can only containt li</li>
         </ul>
      <p>
         3 ways of defining XML languages. Used to be Doctypes. Not possible to describe XHTML5. Schemas are a newer way of describing languages.
         XHTML5 lang is defined by the spec and implemented by the browser. We have to fool old browsers by putting in a dummy doctype = DOCTYPE html
         Then explain which sort of xhtml we're using: xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
      </p>

      <p>
         FYI must and should are defined strictly - good to know for thesis?

      <h3>HTML</h3>
      <p>
         w3schools - not the best resource.
      </p>
      <p>
         Start fluid. Use fixed ayout if have to.
      </p>
      <p>
          Block.<br />
          h1 h2 h3 = headings. p  paragraphs. br = line breaks (don't use where can avoid.)
          ul = un ordered list. ol = orderd list.
          <fieldset> fieldset = box around this.</fieldset>
      </p>

      <p>
         The div tag is useful because it does nothing. But you can attach js or css info to it.
      </p>

      <p>
         HTML5 has new tags. Explains why you're gathering info together. header footer etc.
      </p>

      <p>
         Inline.<br />
         <dfn>dfn = deffinition</dfn><br />
         <var>var = maths variables</var><br />
         <cite>cite = quote</cite><br />
         <samp>samp = fixwidth. Also kbd</samp><br />
         don't use b, i , u ins del etc. Should be used with tags.<br />
         Span in inline version of div.
      </p>

      <h3>HTML5 Tags</h3>
      <p>
         header, footer, nav, main, section, article, aside, figure. Work just like divs. Fairly safe to use with old browsers as long as you use pollyfill.
         There are media tags: svg (vecor graphics), math, canvas, video, audio.
      </p>

      <p>
         tables need tbody. So it goes: table tbody tr td. So that it works with js. Only use tables for tables of data. Not for layouts.
      </p>

      <p>
         Form method get takes data and shoves in on to the end of URL.
